## Summary

Learn how to navigate and manipulate your operating system from the command line, while learning essential skills for professional coding.

## Description

Welcome to the Command Line! This course will teach you how to interact with a computer from a command line interface. If you don't know what a command line interface is, think about the Matrix movies, and the hackers who were banging on their keyboards while staring at black screens with green font.

It looked cool in the Matrix, but why should you learn the command line? The command line is an interface to a computer's operating system, and understand how to use it will increase your productivity as a coder. The command line is so powerful that most coders have it open at all times when they're coding. It's essentially their central command center for creating software.

After you complete this course you'll have a grounding in operations including directory and file management, command execution, and search.

## Objectives

- Describe the command line and what it's used for.
