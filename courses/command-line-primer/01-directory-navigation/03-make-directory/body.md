### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Understand how to make directories in Unix.

### Example

At some point we won't want to be contained by existing directories, and we'll want to create our own. The "make directory" command allows us create a new directory. It's the equivalent of right-clicking on a folder in a GUI and selecting "New Folder".

Making a directory is accomplished with the `mkdir` command, followed by the name of the directory we want to create. For example:

```bash
$ mkdir my_first_directory
```

We can also create a subdirectory:

```bash
$ mkdir my_first_directory/my_subdirectory
```

### Exercise

1. Create a directory with the name of the country you live in.
2. Create a subdirectory with the name of the city you live in.
