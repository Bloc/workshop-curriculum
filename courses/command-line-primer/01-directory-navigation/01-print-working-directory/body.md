### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Understand how to print your current working directory in Unix.
- Apply the `pwd` command to print your active working directory.

### Example

Unix is an operating system that most computers use. Any computer that runs Linux or macOS is based on Unix. Unix provides a set of commands and options for interacting with it, and they will be our focus in this course.

You are already familiar with navigating your computer's operating system, though if you're new to coding you probably do so with a graphical user interface (GUI). That is, you probably click on drives and folders to get to files and edit them. We'll accomplish the same results, but instead of using a GUI we'll use the command line.

The first command we'll learn is named "print working directory" and is executed by typing `pwd`. The command will return your current path name (i.e. location). The `pwd` command is the easiest way to find out "where you are" in your operating system.

### Exercise

1. Use `pwd` command to print the present working directory.
2. You should see the absolute file system path leading to your current directory.
