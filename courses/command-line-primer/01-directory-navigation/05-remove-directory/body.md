### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Understand how to remove directories in Unix.

### Example

Some directories were never meant to be, and for that reason we have the "make directory" command, which allows us to delete a directory. It's the equivalent of right-clicking on a folder in a GUI and selecting "Remove" or "Delete".

Removing a directory is accomplished with the `rmdir` command, followed by the name of the directory we want to create. For example:

```bash
$ rmdir my_first_directory/my_subdirectory
```

### Exercise

1. Remove all of your city directories except for the directory with the name of the city you live in.
