### Exercise

1. Define a method named `fun_with_math`.
2. The method should take four number arguments.
3. The method should return a number that has been calculated as follows:

    - Add the first argument to the second argument.
    - Subtract the third argument from the sum of the first two arguments.
    - Multiply the result of the two operations above by the fourth argument.

> You should take note of the order of operations requested in this exercise. The placement of parentheses will change the result of your method.

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts fun_with_math(4,3,2,1)
=> 5
```
