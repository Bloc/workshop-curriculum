<!-- { ids:[59], language:'Ruby', type:'workshop', order: 6, name:'Numbers', description:'Learn the number data type and apply it in a method.' }-->

### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Define a number data type.
- Understand how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
- Understand how to calculate exponential values.
- Understand how to calculate the remainder of a quotient.
- Understand how to return a number from a method.
- Understand how to print a number.

### Example

Ruby can interpret mathematical operations with numbers:

```ruby
# addition
puts 1 + 2

# subtraction
puts 5 - 1

# division
puts 6 / 2

# multiplication
puts 4 * 3
```

Ruby can also calculate exponentials:

```ruby
puts 2 ** 3
=> 8
```

Ruby also provides a modulo operator, which returns the remainder of a quotient:

```ruby
puts 5 % 2
=> 1
```
