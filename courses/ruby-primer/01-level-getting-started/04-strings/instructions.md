### Exercise

1. Define a method named `reverse_me`.
2. The method should take a string as an argument.
3. The method should return the string in reverse order.

In use:

```ruby
puts reverse_me("Hello!")
=> "!olleH"

puts reverse_me("Why?")
=> "?yhW"

puts reverse_me("RacecaR")
=> "RacecaR"
```

As a programmer, a big part of your job is to read technical documentation. The Ruby language – all of its data types and their methods – are well documented. And even seasoned coders refer to the documentation.

To complete this exercise, browse [Ruby's string methods](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html) and find one that will reverse the string. You can call this method inside of `reverse_me`. As a hint, Ruby methods are [well-named](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-reverse).
