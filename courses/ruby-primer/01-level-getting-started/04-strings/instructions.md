### Exercise

1. Define a method named `reverse_me`.
2. The method should take a string as an argument.
3. The method should return the string in reverse order.

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts reverse_me("Daenerys Targaryen")
=> "neyragraT syreneaD"
```

As a coder, a big part of your job is to read technical documentation, also known as APIs. The Ruby language – all of its data types and their methods – are documented. Even seasoned coders refer to documentation. To complete this exercise, view [Ruby's string methods](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html) and find one that will reverse a string. You can call this method inside of `reverse_me`. As a hint, Ruby methods are [very well-named](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-reverse).
