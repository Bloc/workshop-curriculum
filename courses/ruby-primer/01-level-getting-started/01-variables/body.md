<!-- { ids:[54], language:'Ruby', type:'workshop', order: 0, name:'Variables', description:'Learn what a variable is, and how to assign a value to a variable.' }-->

### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- State what a variable is.
- Remember how to assign a string to a variable.
- Remember how to assign a number to a variable.

### Example

A variable is an object that can store a value. Variables can be named almost anything as long as the name starts with a lowercase letter. Create a variable named `my_name` and assign your name to it. For example, type the following in the code editor, only with your name instead of "Mike":

```ruby
my_name = "Mike"
```

Notice the `=` in the code above; this is an assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. `my_name` is a variable, and it now stores the value of your name. We can prove this by printing the value of `my_name`:

```ruby
puts my_name
```

Click the **Run** button and you should see your name printed in the Results area below the editor. `puts` is a Ruby command that prints a value.

Numbers can also be assigned to variables. Create a variable named `my_age` and assign your age to it:

```ruby
my_age = 38
```
