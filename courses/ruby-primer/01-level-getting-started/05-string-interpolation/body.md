### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Understand how to insert variables in a string.

### Example

String interpolation is the act of inserting variables into a string. This is useful for sending customized messages to a user of your program. Let's write a simple program that can be used to welcome visitors to a new country:

```ruby
def welcome_to(country)
  "Welcome to #{country}, enjoy your stay!"
end
```

This syntax – `#{ }` denotes the variable to be interpolated. When used in a string, it will print the variable provided as part of the string. When called, this would return:

```ruby
puts welcome_to("Japan")
=> "Welcome to Japan, enjoy your stay!"
```

One of the great thing about interpolated variables is that they're not limited to strings. We'll cover numbers later, but here's a glimpse of how we can interpolate numbers in a string:

```ruby
def add_numbers(number1, number2)
  "The sum of #{number1} and #{number2} is #{number1 + number2}."
end
```

When we pass two numbers to this method, our numbers will be interpolated as strings, as will the sum operation (`#{number1 + number2}`):

```ruby
puts add_numbers(2,5)
=> "The sum of 2 and 5 is 7."
```

### Exercise

1. Define a method named `say_my_name`
2. The method should take two arguments which represent a first name and a last name.
3. The method should return a string formatted as `"My name is Abe Lincoln."` if its arguments were `"Abe"` and `"Lincoln"`.

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts say_my_name("George", "Washington")
=> "My name is George Washington."
```
