<!-- { ids:[123], language:'Ruby', type:'workshop', order: 4, name:'String Interpolation', description:'Learn how to insert variables into a string.' }-->

### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Insert variables into a string.

### Example

Interpolation converts data into readable strings. This process can help you send customized messages to your users. Let's write a simple program that welcomes visitors to a new country:

```ruby
def welcome_to(country)
  "Welcome to #{country}, enjoy your stay!"
end
```

Strings will interpolate the statements in curly braces â€“Â `#{ }`. When used with a variable, the string will include the value of the varialbe as part of the string. If we call `welcome_to` with, "Japan," this returns:

```ruby
puts welcome_to("Japan")
=> "Welcome to Japan, enjoy your stay!"
```

And interpolated statements are not limited to strings! We'll cover numbers later, but here's a glimpse of how to interpolate them:

```ruby
def add_numbers(number1, number2)
  "The sum of #{number1} and #{number2} is #{number1 + number2}."
end
```

When we pass two numbers to this method, the string interpolates our numbers and the summation (`#{number1 + number2}`):

```ruby
puts add_numbers(2,5)
=> "The sum of 2 and 5 is 7."
```
