## Summary

Learn about strings, loops, arrays, hashes, and much more. Test your skills and build your knowledge of the Ruby programming language.

## Description

Welcome to Ruby! This course will teach you the fundamentals of the Ruby programming language. Why should you take this course, you ask? Here are some possible answers:

You've heard about this "coding" thing and it sounds cool. Since you want to learn what it's all about, you'll start learning with one of the most readable programming languages on Earth.

You have an idea for the next great social web application. Seriously, it's going to be 10 times as big as Facebook. All you need to know is how to build a web application. Ruby is the programming language that drives many web applications, most of which use a framework named Ruby on Rails. (Oh yeah, to be 10 times as big as Facebook you'll also need a couple billion more people on the planet.)

There are thousands of programming languages and each one is unique. Fortunately, all programming languages share similar concepts. In addition to learning the Ruby language, you'll also learn common programming concepts in this course; concepts like debugging, data types, variables, conditional logic, and loops.

That's enough of a prelude. You're ready to learn and we're ready to teach. Let's get started.

## Objectives

After this course students should be able to:

- Define the data types available in Ruby.
- Understand how to define methods.
- Understand how to pass arguments.
- Understand how to return a value from a method.
- Understand how to debug syntax errors.
- Apply conditional expressions and operators.
- Demonstrate how to access elements in an array.
- Demonstrate how to access elements in a hash.
- Apply the `each` method to iterate over an array.
- Understand the concept of iteration.
- Explain what a block is and how it can be used as an argument.
