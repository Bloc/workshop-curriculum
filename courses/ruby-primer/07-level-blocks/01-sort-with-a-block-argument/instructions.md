### Exercise

1. Define a method named `sort_by_length`.
2. The method should take an array of strings as an argument.
3. The method should return an array of strings sorted by their length value, from shortest length to longest length.

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts sort_by_length(["Arya", "Sansa", "Lyanna", "Jon"])
=> ["Jon", "Arya", "Sansa", "Lyanna"]
```
