### Exercise

1. Define a method named `multiply_the_odds`.
2. The method should take an array of numbers as an argument.
3. The method should return the product of all numbers with an odd index position.
4. The method should return `0` if passed an empty array.
5. The method should return `1` if passed a single element array.

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts multiply_the_odds([1,3,5,7,9,11])
# multiples 3 * 7 * 11
=> 231

puts multiply_the_odds([])
=> 0

puts multiply_the_odds([100])
=> 1
```
