### Exercise

1. Define a method named `odd_or_even`.
2. The method should take one string argument.
3. The method should return a string that reads `"odd"` if the string length is odd, and `"even"` if the string length is even. You must use a `case` expression to implement this method.

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts odd_or_even("Ruby")
=> "even"

puts odd_or_even("Rails")
=> "odd"
```

> Remember the modulo (`%`) operator? It will help you complete this exercise.
