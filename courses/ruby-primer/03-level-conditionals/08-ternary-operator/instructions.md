### Exercise

1. Define a method named `odd_or_even`.
2. The method should take two string arguments.
3. The method should return a string that reads `"odd"` if the sum of the two string lengths is odd, and `"even"` if the sum of the two string lengths is even. You must use a ternary operator to implement this method.

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts odd_or_even("Ruby", "Rails")
=> "odd"

puts odd_or_even("Ruby", "Code")
=> "even"
```
