### Exercise

1. Define a method named `hello`. Run your code again, before completing the next steps. Note that the `NoMethodError` is gone, but the tests fail. This is because you've properly _defined_ the method, but have not _implemented_ it yet.
2. The method should take a `name` argument.
3. The method should return a string that reads "Hello", followed by the `name` argument and an exclamation point ("!").

The completed method can be called like this:

```ruby
puts hello("Ruby")
=> "Hello Ruby!"
```
