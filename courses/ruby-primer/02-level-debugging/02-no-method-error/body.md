<!-- { ids:[], language:'Ruby', type:'workshop', order: 1, name:'No Method Error', description:"Debug your code when it doesn't recognize a method." }-->

### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Remember what a No Method error is.
- Identify a No Method error.

### Example

Don't type anything in your code editor, just click **Run**. You should see an error:

```bash
NoMethodError: undefined method 'hello'
```

This means that your tests tried to call the `hello` method but couldn't find the method definition. It couldn't find the method because we haven't defined it yet!
