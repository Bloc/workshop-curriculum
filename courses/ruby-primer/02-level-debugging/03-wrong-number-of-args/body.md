<!-- { ids:[], language:'Ruby', type:'workshop', order: 2, name:'Wrong Number of Arguments Error', description:'Debug your code when a method is called with unexpected arguments.' }-->

### Objectives

After this exercise you should be able to:

- Remember what a Wrong Number of Arguments error is.
- Identify a Wrong Number of Arguments error.

### Example

You should see some code in your editor:

```ruby
def hello
  ""
end
```

Click **Run**. You should see the following error:

```bash
wrong number of arguments (2 for 0)
```

The method is being called with two arguments in the tests, but our method doesn't define any arguments.
