### Exercise

Write a function named `getColorType`. This function should:

  - take one argument, a color
  - if the color is one of the primary colors (red, blue, yellow), the function should return the string `"The color <color> is a primary color!"`
  - if the color is one of the secondary colors (violet, green, orange), the function should return `"The color <color> is a secondary color!"`
  - if the color is something else, the function should return `"Sorry, I don't know that color."`

For example:

```js
getColorType("orange"); // returns "The color orange is a secondary color!"
```
