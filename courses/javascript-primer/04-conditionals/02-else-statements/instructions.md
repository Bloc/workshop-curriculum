### Exercise

Update the `greet` function. If the hour is _not_ less than 12, the function should return `"Good afternoon!"`.

We're using "military time" (the 24-hour clock) for this function, which is generally what computers use to keep track of time. For example, 1 p.m. is 13 and 11 p.m. is 23.
