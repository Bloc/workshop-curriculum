### Exercise

The number 13 may be unlucky, but we don't believe in that too much... not really... just a little maybe. Just to be safe, we'll avoid that number, but we need to get on with our life and our `for` loops.

Update the loop so that if 13 is a number from `num1` through `num2`, then the loop skips it (the number 13) and continues to push the rest of the numbers to the array.
