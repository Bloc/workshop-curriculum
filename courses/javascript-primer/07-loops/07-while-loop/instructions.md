### Exercise

Write a function called `indexToString`. This function should:

  - take an array as an argument
  - return a new array of strings based on the passed array
  - each string in the returned array should be formatted like so: "<index> is <element at index>"

For example:

```js
indexToString([1, 2, 3]);              // returns ["0 is 1", "1 is 2", "2 is 3"]
indexToString(["shake", "it", "off"]); // returns ["0 is shake", "1 is it", "2 is off"]
```
