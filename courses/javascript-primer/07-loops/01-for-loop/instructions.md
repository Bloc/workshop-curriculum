### Exercise

Write a function called `addToArray`. This function should:

  - take two arguments, `num1` and `num2`
  - use a `for` loop to iterate through each number between `num1` and `num2` and add each number to an array

For example:

```js
addToArray(3,7);   // returns [3,4,5,6,7]
addToArray(22,24); // returns [22,23,24]
```

Before writing the function, decide:

1. What value should the counter variable start with? In other words, at what value should the loop start?
2. What condition is the loop checking each time it runs? In other words, for what condition/value should the loop end?
3. What should happen to the counter variable at the end of each loop? Should it increase, decrease, do nothing? In other words, what needs to happen to the counter variable to get it from where the loops starts to where it should end?
