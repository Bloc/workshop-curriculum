### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Demonstrate how to get the length of an array

### Example

The number of elements in an array is information that scripts often rely on to perform various operations. Because it's common information, JavaScript has a built-in property (remember that an array is a type of object) that can be accessed on all arrays: the `length` property.

For example, to get the number of elements that are in the `fruits` array:

```js
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
fruits.length; // returns 3
```
