### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- State what an array is

### Example

While objects store data using _named_ positions called properties, __arrays__ store lists of data in _numerical_ positions called indices. In other words, information in an object is stored without regard to order, but order in an array is important.

Let's say you have three fruits on your kitchen counter:

1. apple
2. banana
3. orange

This particular set of data doesn't adhere well to the format of an object since we're not storing properties and values. This data set is better suited as an array. Generally, data stored in an array is similar, such as a list of names, phone numbers, locations, etc.

As an array, this list of fruits would be stored like this:

| Index | Value    |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0     | "apple"  |
| 1     | "banana" |
| 2     | "orange" |

Notice that arrays in JavaScript use 0 as a starting index, not 1.

### Exercise

Use the table of information shown above to create variables named `fruit1`, `fruit2`, and `fruit3` and assign them the appropriate values.

These variables, on their own, represent individual fruits. But the data is in the form of a list, not individual pieces, so we need to group the information together; we need to create an array. Go to the next exercise to learn how.
