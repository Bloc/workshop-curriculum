### Example

Strings and numbers in JavaScript are primary data types, as we've learned, along with booleans, undefined, and null. Everything else in JavaScript is an object, which is a way to store data and functions in one location.

In JavaScript, objects are a collection of properties and values. A property (sometimes referred to as a tag or key) names a location used to access a value. A value can be any type: string, number, boolean, undefined, null, or even another object, including functions and arrays.

JavaScript objects are like dictionaries. A dictionary is a set of data, while the words in a dictionary are single elements that are assigned definitions. When we want to retrieve a definition (a value), we use a word (a property) to locate that information in a dictionary. Unlike a dictionary, however, in which words are ordered alphabetically, you are not required to order object properties in a particular way.

A Simple Object

an orange

Consider the object shown above. We know (or at the very least, presume) it's an orange because of certain properties it exhibits. For example, its color is orange and its shape is round:

| Property | Value  |
| -------- | ------ |
| color	   | orange |
| shape	   | round  |

JavaScript objects, like real-world objects, have properties which we use to access values.
