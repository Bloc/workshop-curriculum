### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:



### Example

There are two ways to add properties to an object: dot syntax or bracket syntax.

For example, to add a `size` property to `orange` using dot syntax, we would write:

```js
orange.size = "small";
```

To add the same property using bracket syntax, we would write:

```js
orange["size"] = "small";
```

The `orange` object now has two key-value pairs:

| Property | Value    |
| -------- | -------- |
| color	   | "orange" |
| shape	   | "round"  |
| size     | "small"  |
