### Example

We've learned that objects are a way to store data, but JavaScript also uses arrays to store lists of data. An array is a type of JavaScript object (we'll learn more about this in a later checkpoint). Like objects, arrays can store any number of values of any type at the same time. While objects have named properties that hold values, arrays have numerical locations (indexed positions) that hold values. In other words, information in an object is stored without regard to order, but order in an array is important.

A Simple Array

An array that has three strings

The diagram above visually depicts a list of three fruit names as an array: "apple", "banana", "orange". The fruit names are values located at indexed positions:

Index	Value
0	"apple"
1	"banana"
2	"orange"
Arrays in JavaScript use 0 as a starting index, not 1.
