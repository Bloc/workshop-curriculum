## Summary

Learn about syntax, functions, objects, arrays, loops, and much more. Test your skills and build your knowledge of the JavaScript programming language.

## Description

This course will teach you the fundamentals of the JavaScript scripting language – _the_ language of the Web.

There are many programming languages and each one is unique. Fortunately, all programming languages share similar concepts. In addition to learning the JavaScript language, you'll also learn common programming concepts in this course; concepts like debugging, data types, variables, conditional logic, and loops.

## Objectives

After this course students should be able to:

- Store and use data with variables.
- Manipulate values in the console.
- Use and manipulate functions as expressions.
- Use conditionals to control the flow of your code with `if` and `else` statements.
- Create, fill, and manipulate the generic JavaScript object literal.
