### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Recognize an anonymous function

### Example

When a function doesn't have a declared name (an identifier) it is known as an __anonymous function__. For example:

```js
function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

Because this function doesn't have a name, however, we cannot call it. Despite this, there are use cases for anonymous functions, which we'll cover in the next exercise.
