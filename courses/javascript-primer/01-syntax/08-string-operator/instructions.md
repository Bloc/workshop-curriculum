### Exercise

Divide the long string into five shorter ones and assign each section of the string to one of the already declared variables (e.g. `var quotePt1`). Use the string operator to concatenate the variables (strings) together to recreate the full quote and assign the result to the `quoteFull` variable. Be mindful of whitespace.

```js
var string1 = "Hello";
var string2 = " World!";
var stringFull = string1 + string2; // returns "Hello World!"
```
