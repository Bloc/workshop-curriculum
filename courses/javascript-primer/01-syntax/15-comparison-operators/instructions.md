### Exercise

There are ten variables declared in the editor. Determine which expressions do not use a comparison operator and remove their assignments from the editor.

```js
var comparison11 = 42 + 4;
```

For example, if you think the expression assigned to `comparison11` does not use a comparison operator, then remove its assigned value and leave it like so:

```js
var comparison11;
```
