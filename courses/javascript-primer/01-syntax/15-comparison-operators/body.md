### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Recognize comparison operators
- List the comparison operators
- State what each comparison operator does

### Example

Boolean expressions generally use __comparison operators__ to compare values and return a value of `true` or `false`. The compared values can be numbers, strings, booleans, or one of JavaScript's other data types. Here's a list of JavaScript's comparison operators:

| Operator                      | Returns `true` if the...                                                 | Examples that return `true` |
| :---------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `==`<br>equal                 | values are equal                                                         | `'2' == 2`                  |
| `===`<br>strict equal         | values are equal and of the same type                                    | `2 === 2`                   |
| `!=`<br>not equal             | values are not equal                                                     | `"Howdy" != "Hello"`        |
| `!==`<br>strict not equal     | values are of the same data type but not equal, or are of different type | `"Howdy" !== "howdy"`       |
| `>`<br>greater than           | left value is greater than the right value                               | `4 > 3`                     |
| `>=`<br>greater than or equal | left value is greater than or equal to the right value                   | `4 >= 4`                    |
| `<`<br>less than              | left value is less than the right value                                  | `"Hi" < "Hello"`            |
| `<=`<br>less than or equal    | left value is less than or equal to the right value                      | `4 <= 5`                    |
