### Exercise

Look at the values in the editor. Decide whether the value is truthy or falsy and change its variable name accordingly.

For example, if you think `var truthyOrFalsy11 = false` is falsy, then change the variable name from `truthyOrFalsy11` to `falsy11`. Do not change the values assigned to the variables.
