### Exercise

The previous exercise contained code that you may not have understood. With comments, however, we can clarify what the code is doing.

The code from the previous exercise is now in the editor with some comments added. How many single- and multi-line comments do you count?

Answer by assigning `numberOfSingleLineComments` (line 18) and `numberOfMultiLineComments` (line 19) numerical values equal to the number of single- and multi-line comments you find, respectively.
