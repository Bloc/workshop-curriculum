### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Recognize a comment
- Explain what a comment is

### Example

You should add __comments__ to explain what your code does. Comments are text within a script that the JavaScript interpreter does not process.

Comments make code easier to read and understand. They help others who read your code as well as help you get reacquainted with your own code if you haven't worked on it in awhile.

A single-line comment spans only one line and does not need to start at the beginning of a line. It can be added to a line after a statement or other piece of JavaScript code. Here's an example of a single-line comment:

```js
// A single-line comment starts with two forward slashes
```

A multi-line comment can span multiple lines and usually starts at the beginning of a new line. Here's an example of a multi-line comment:

```js
/* A multi-line comment starts with a
   forward slash and asterisk
   and ends with an
   asterisk and forward slash. */
```

### Exercise

The previous exercise contained code that you may not have understood. With comments, however, we can clarify what the code is doing.

The code from the previous exercise is now in the editor with some comments added. How many single- and multi-line comments do you count?

Answer by assigning `numberOfSingleLineComments` (line 18) and `numberOfMultiLineComments` (line 19) values that are the number of single- and multi-line comments you find, respectively.
