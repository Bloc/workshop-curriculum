### Exercise

Look at the values in the editor. Decide whether the value is a `number`, `string`, or `boolean` and change its variable name accordingly.

For example, if you think `var dataType11 = "I am a string"` is a string, then change the variable name from `dataType11` to `string11`. Do not change the values assigned to the variables.
