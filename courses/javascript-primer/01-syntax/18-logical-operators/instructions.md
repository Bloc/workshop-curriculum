### Exercise

There are six variables declared in the editor. Determine which variables are assigned expressions that evaluate to `false` and remove their assignments.

```
var logical7 = 42 + 4;
```

For example, if you think the expression assigned to `logical7` evaluates to `false`, then remove its assigned value and leave it like so:

```
var logical7;
```
