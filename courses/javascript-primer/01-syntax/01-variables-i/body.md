### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Declare a variable
- State what a variable is
- Recognize the assignment operator
- State what the assignment operator does
- Assign a value to a variable

### Example

In JavaScript, __variables__ store data. To declare a variable, use the `var` keyword followed by the name of the variable:

```js
var numberOfOceans;
```

A variable stores information, and this information is known as a __value__. You can assign a value to a variable on the same line as the declaration by using the __assignment operator__ (`=`), which assigns the value on the left to the variable name on the right:

```js
var numberOfOceans = 5;
```

Or you can assign a value after the declaration:

```js
var numberOfOceans;
numberOfOceans = 5;
```

### Exercise

Declare a variable named `numberOfStatesInUSA`. Assign that variable the number of states that make up the USA. If you do not know this number, do a search or phone a friend.
