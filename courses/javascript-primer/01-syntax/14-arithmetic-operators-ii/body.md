### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- List some non-standard arithmetic operators
- Explain what the non-standard arithmetic operators do
- Demonstrate how to use non-standard arithmetic operators

### Example

JavaScript has a few other arithmetic operators, three of which are:

| Operator          | Description                                                    | Example           | Evaluates to |
| :---------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `%`<br>modulus    | Divides one value by another and returns the integer remainder | `10 % 3`          | `1`          |
| `++`<br>increment | Adds one to the current number                                 | `x = 10`<br>`x++` | `11`         |
| `--`<br>decrement | Subtracts one from the current number                          | `x = 10`<br>`x--` | `9`          |
