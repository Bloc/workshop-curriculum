### Exercise

There are six variables declared in the editor. Three of the variables have good identifiers and three of them do not. Determine the three poorly-named variables and remove their assignments.

```js
var AwFuL_Var_nAmE = "some value";
```

For example, if you think `AwFuL_Var_nAmE` is a bad identifier, then remove its assigned value and leave it like so:

```js
var AwFuL_Var_nAmE;
```
