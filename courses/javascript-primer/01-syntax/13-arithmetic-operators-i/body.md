<!--{ ids:[], language:'JavaScript', type:'workshop', order: 13, name:'Arithmetic Operators I', description:'Use standard arithmetic operators to perform math operations.' }-->

### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- List the standard arithmetic operators
- Explain what the standard arithmetic operators do
- Use the standard arithmetic operators to create expressions

### Example

Arithmetic expressions generally use __arithmetic operators__ to return a value. An arithmetic operator takes numerical values as its operands and returns a single numerical value.

The standard arithmetic operators are:

- addition (`+`)
- subtraction (`-`)
- multiplication (`*`)
- division (`/`)

Some examples of expressions that use arithmetic operators:

```
5 + 6  // evaluates to 11
11 - 6 // evaluates to 5
13 * 3 // evaluates to 39
42 / 7 // evaluates to 6
```

### Exercise

Match the expressions listed in the comment to the appropriate variable name by assigning the expressions as values. For example, if the expression adds two numbers together, assign the expression to the `addition` variable.
