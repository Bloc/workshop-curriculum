Leap years are divisible by 4 (like 1992 and 1996). There's one exception though: if a year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year (like 1800), unless it is also divisible by 400 (like the year 2000).

Write a `leap_year?` method that takes a year as an argument and returns `true` if the year is a leap year and `false` if it is not. The `%` operator will come in handy for this program.

```
# if a year is not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year
# else, if year is divisible by four hundred, it's a leap year
# else, if a year is divisible by one hundred, it's not a leap year
# else, if a year is divisible by four, it's a leap year
```
