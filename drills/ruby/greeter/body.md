Write a program with a `hello` method that takes someone's first and last name as separate arguments and then says hello to them. For example:

```
hello("Steve", "Jobs") #=> returns "Hello Steve Jobs."
hello("Bill", "Gates") #=> returns "Hello Bill Gates."
```

If you need a refresher on how to create methods, review that checkpoint before moving on. As a reminder, here's the `add` method that we wrote:

```
def add(num1, num2)
  num1 + num2
end
```

If you have problems, it's important to look closely at the error messages. To pass the test, you must "code to spec", which means your code must fulfill the expectations of the test.
