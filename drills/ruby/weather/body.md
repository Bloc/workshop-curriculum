Write a program with a `weather`method that accepts city names (as symbols) as arguments. The program should look up the weather in a city from a hash and return the temperature. Here are the values you should use:

* San Francisco: 60
* Chicago: 30
* Miami: 70
* Los Angeles: 80
* Anchorage: 10

In Ruby, it's conventional to represent spaces in variable names, symbols, and methods as underscores. (this is known as **snake case**) In this respect, San Francisco would be written as :san_francisco.
