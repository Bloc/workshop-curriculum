* Create a `Dictionary` class. When you create a new `dictionary` (such as one for English), it should be an empty hash.
* Write a method to add words and their definitions by passing in a hash as an argument.
* Write a method to list all of the words and their definitions in alphabetical order.
* Write a method to search the `dictionary` by passing in the first few letters of a word and returning all of the words that start with those letters, along with their definitions.
