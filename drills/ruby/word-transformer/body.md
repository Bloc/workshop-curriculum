Write a program with three methods that take strings as arguments:

```
echo #=> should repeat the string twice
shout #=> should repeat the string in uppercase
reverse #=> should repeat the string in reverse
```

The `upcase` and `reverse` methods will come in handy. Review these in the [Ruby API](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html) if you need a refresher.

You should close your methods when you define them. For example:

```
def new_method

end
```
