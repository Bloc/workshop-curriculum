My favorite number is 13. Write a program with a `favorite` method that takes a number as an argument. If the number is less than 13, return "Little higher..."; if
it's more than 13, return "Little lower..."; and if it's 13, return "That's my favorite number!"

Use indentation to make your code easy to read. Not indenting might save you a few fractions of a second, but it will cost you enormous headaches when
something goes wrong and you can't figure out why. Here's a reminder of what good indentation looks like:

```
def my_method
  if #something
    #do something
  elsif #something else
    #do something else
  end
end
```
