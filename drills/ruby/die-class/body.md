Create a `Die` class. You should be able to create a new `die` and specify the number of sides in an argument.

The `sides` method should return the number of sides the `die` has. The `roll` method should return a random integer between 1 and the number of sides the `die` has. Hint: use the `rand` method we used earlier in the roadmap.
