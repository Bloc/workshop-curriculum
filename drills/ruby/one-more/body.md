Write a program with a `one_more` method that takes an array as an argument and returns an array with the last element repeated. For example:

```
one_more([1,2,3]) #=> returns [1,2,3,3]
```

Hint: there's an array method named `last`. You should get very familiar with arrays by reading the [API documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html)
