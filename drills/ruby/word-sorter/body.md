Write a program with a `word_sort` method that takes an array of lowercase words as an argument and returns them in alphabetical order. For example:

```
word_sort(["banana", "cherry", "apple"]) #=> returns ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

> The `sort` method should make this program pretty easy.
