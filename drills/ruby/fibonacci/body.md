This is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence: "0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ..."

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1 (by definition). Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

Create a `fibonacci` instance method in the Integer class that returns the value of the Fibonacci sequence corresponding to the integer it was called on. For example, `8.fibonacci` should return `21`. Remember, the first element in the sequence has an index of 0.

View Salman Khan's [great explanation](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/computer-science/v/stepping-through-recursive-fibonacci-function) of recursion and Fibonacci. Note: concentrate on his conceptual example, and try to ignore the white block of code at the top of the screen. (We want you to code it yourself!)

Think about why it would be a bad idea to run `100.fibonacci`. Just think about this, but don't run it. You might crash Bloc!
