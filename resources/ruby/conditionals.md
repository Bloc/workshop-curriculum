Programs often need to do different things based on conditional logic. One way to evaluate conditions and control the program is by using `if` statements. `if` statements consider a given condition, and then do something based on the result of the condition. For example, consider the following statement:

```md
"If Mary has more than $5, then give her an apple."
```

Let's write a program for this behavior: `can_buy_apple_with?`:

```ruby
# define the method
def can_buy_apple_with?(money)
  if money > 5
    "have an apple"
  end
end

# call the method, passing in a 7
can_buy_apple_with?(7)
#=> "have an apple"

# call the method, passing in a 5
can_buy_apple_with?(5)
#=> nil
```

Remember that in Ruby, the last evaluated line of a method is returned from the method by default. In the first example above, where we call the method and pass a `7`, the last evaluated line is `"have an apple"`. This means that the `"have an apple"` string would be returned if `money` is `7` (i.e. if the `if` statement evaluates to `true`).

When we pass a `5` to the method in the second example, the `if` condition does not evaluate to `true`, so the method will return `nil`. It returns `nil` because we are not doing anything when `money` is not greater than `5`.

> Always use `end` to close an `if` statement.

### Else

If this method was in a real program, returning `nil` if there's not enough money to buy an apple would not create a great user experience. We'd want to tell the user something if they don't have enough money to buy an apple. In the example below, let's offer the user an alternative:

```ruby
def can_buy_apple_with?(money)
  if money > 5
    "have an apple"
  else
    "sorry, how about some gum?"
  end
end

# call the method, passing in a 7
can_buy_apple_with?(7)
#=> "have an apple"

# call the method, passing in a 5
can_buy_apple_with?(5)
#=> "sorry, how about some gum?"
```

In the example above we used an `else` to handle the condition where `money` is not greater than `5`. We didn't need to specify a condition for `else` because it will handle the opposite of the `if`. In other words, when the `if` statement evaluates to `false`, the `else` branch will be executed. In plain English, you could describe the program:

```md
"If you have more than $5, you can have an apple; if not you may have some gum."
```

> We still need an `end` to close the `if` statement, but it's placed after the `else` branch.

It's a "best practice" to define an `else` condition for most `if` statements, because an `if` _always implies an `else`_. If we don't specify what happens if the `if` isn't true, a default of `nil` is returned, as in the first example.

### Else If

We can expand the logic even further:

```ruby
def can_buy_apple_with?(money)
  if money > 1_000
    "have an Apple computer"
  elsif money > 5
    "have an apple"
  elsif money == 5
    "have some gum"
  else
    "get out of my store"
  end
end

# call the method, passing in a 2_000
can_buy_apple_with?(2_000)
#=> "have an Apple computer"

# call the method, passing in a 6
can_buy_apple_with?(6)
#=> "have an apple"

# call the method, passing in a 5
can_buy_apple_with?(5)
#=> "have some gum"

# call the method, passing in a 4
can_buy_apple_with?(4)
#=> "get out of my store"
```

Using `elsif` (there's no second "e" in "elsif") provides even more options for our program. We still use an `else` statement to handle any condition that doesn't evaluate to `true` in the `if` and `elsif` statements.

### `unless` and `!`

`unless` is the opposite of `if`. Use it in simple cases where it makes the conditional easier to read. If you are dealing with a more complex statement, it is better to use a `!` (called a "bang" in programming) to flip the case of the conditional. Consider the following example:

```ruby
def can_buy_apple_with?(money)
  unless money < 1_000
    "have an Apple computer"
  else
    "have an apple"
  end
end
```

As you can see, using `unless` in the example above makes the code a little hard to read. You could refactor using `if` of course, but for the sake of another example you could also use the `!`, as mentioned above. The "bang" basically reads as "not". For example:

```ruby
def can_buy_apple_with?(money)
  if !(money < 1_000)
    "have an Apple computer"
  else
    "have an apple"
  end
end
```

You could read the `if` statement above as:

```md
"If money is not less than 1,000, have an apple computer..."
```

> Using a simple `if` and flipping the conditional logic (`if money > 1_000`) is simpler overall, but it's important to understand your options.


### One Line Conditionals

You can also use `if` and `unless` at the end of one line statements:

```ruby
gets_discount = true
price *= 0.8 if gets_discount

skip_tax = true
price += price * 0.1 unless skip_tax
```

If `gets_discount` is true (which it is), then you'll discount the price by 20%. Unless `skip_tax` is true, you'll add a 10% tax to the price.

One-line conditionals are helpful, but they can be less clear than their multi-line alternatives.

> When in doubt, favor clarity over brevity.

Clear code is easier to maintain, share, and rewrite. As you will see, it's fun to cram a lot of functionality into a small space â€” but try to avoid sacrificing clarity for space.

## Proper Indentation

Proper indentation becomes __even more important__ when handling conditional logic. Before trying the exercises for this checkpoint, read the following code snippet and rewrite it with proper indentation in a message to your mentor.

```ruby
number = rand(25) - 10
if number < 0
puts "The number is negative."
elsif number < 10
if number <= 5
puts "The number is between 0 and 5, inclusive."
else
puts "The number is between 5 and 10, exclusive."
end
else
puts "The number is greater than or equal to 10."
end
```

Compare your solution to the solution below. The indented version is easier to follow than the unindented version.

```ruby
number = rand(25) - 10
if number < 0
  puts "The number is negative."
elsif number < 10
  if number <= 5
    puts "The number is between 0 and 5, inclusive."
  else
    puts "The number is between 5 and 10, exclusive."
  end
else
  puts "The number is greater than or equal to 10."
end
```
